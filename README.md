* IFSC Top/Bonus


## System Components
### web
Mobile-supported web application for spectators to display real-time information. There are 2 key features:

1. A list of climbers who are currently on the wall
2. Sorted and ranked list of climbers with their scores on each route


### judge
Android app for judges to submit scores. Emphasis placed on a simple and easy-to-use interface to reduce judges' workload. App uses QR code to identify climbers, but the keypad is available to manually enter the climber's ID as a backup. The app is fail-safe even if there is no internet connection - scores will be stored in a queue and sent out in sequence when connection is re-established.


### paper
Generator for physical scoresheets with unique QR codes for every climber. Produces a single PDF file to send for printing. It would be nice if you have a few minions to cut and sort them for distribution. Distributing the scoresheets in the call-zone will prevent climbers from losing them.
