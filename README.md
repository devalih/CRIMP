<!-- Badges -->

## Demo (Available August 2016)
* Download the app from [Google Play]()
* Send scores and play around on the app
* See live changes on [demo.crimp.rocks](https://demo.crimp.rocks)

## Components
#### Judge App ([demo]())
Android app for judges to submit scores. We're looking for an iOS developer to help us work on an app for Apple devices!

#### Spectator Scoreboard ([demo]())
Mobile responsive website for spectators to see the scores.

#### Admin Dashboard ([demo]())
Interface for admins to have a quick overview of the system and edit the data.

#### Climber Scoresheet ([demo]())
Generator for physical scoresheets with unique QR codes for every climber. Linked to the Admin Dashboard to generate and download a PDF file of the scoresheets for all the climbers in a category in just a click.

## Supported Scoring Systems
The system is able to handle several scoring systems running simultaneously. We will add more scoring systems on a as-needed basis. Alternatively, you can write it and make a pull request to us. See CONTRIBUTING.md for more info on how you can contribute :)
